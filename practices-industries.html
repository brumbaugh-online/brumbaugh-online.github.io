<h2>Intellectual Property Management</h2>
<p>Brumbaugh, Inc. uses intellectual property management tools to help clients develop systems to manage the life cycle of their company’s intellectual property worldwide. There is more to intellectual property than just filing patents and trademarks. Among the spectrum of services we offer are:<br>Threat Assessment:<br>It is increasingly common for companies to receive letters threatening legal action because of alleged patent or trademark infringement. We can help design procedures to respond to these letters. For example, we have devised web-based tools that categorize threats and provide a framework to assess and manage the risks presented by such “nastygrams”—significantly lightening the load on in-house legal departments. Additionally, our deep understanding of our clients’ sectors enables us to leverage our know-how to minimize the impact on companies’ businesses.<br>Audits and Categorization:<br>Our lawyers can help implement inventor education programs so a company’s scientists and engineers better understand how to protect new ideas. We also review a client’s technology and perform a gap analysis or identify areas that could be protected more effectively. We can also compare the product mix with current and proposed trademarks to design filing and enforcement strategies. This analysis allows us to identify strengths and weaknesses in the current process and to benchmark an intellectual property portfolio against those of competitors.<br>Patent Mining: <br>Often companies have more valuable intellectual property assets than they realize. Our lawyers can undertake a quantitative and qualitative review of an existing patent portfolio to identify potentially infringed or underutilized patents. Following a mining effort, we will create a licensing and enforcement program that could include contingent recovery or other alternative fee engagements.<br>Valuation:<br>Our lawyers can help determine the economic value of a client’s intellectual property assets, either with the assistance of the company’s own personnel or with consultants we have used in the past. We have long-standing relationships with the major consulting firms and often work closely with them to perform such valuations.<br><br>Brumbaugh, Inc. has a simple philosophy to manage intellectual property assets: put our best practices in our clients’ hands.

<h2>EU Intellectual Property/Antitrust</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been a remarkable expansion of antitrust enforcement in the area of intellectual property. This trend is illustrated by an increasing willingness of the European Commission and other antitrust enforcement agencies to challenge IP-related transactions, often on the basis of novel theories of competitive harm. This is particularly true where intellectual property rights are of strategic importance, as is the case with respect to so-called Standard Essential Patents. Examples are the EU Commission’s investigations into the use of injunctive relief procedures and the determination of FRAND-licensing terms in the mobile telecommunications area, as well as pay-for-delay patent settlements in the pharmaceutical sector.<br><br>As a result, the inter-relationship between antitrust and intellectual property has become of prime importance to a broad range of industries, including high-tech, telecoms and pharmaceuticals. Both intellectual property owners and users must take antitrust considerations into account when acquiring, protecting, managing, licensing and monetizing valuable proprietary technology and related intellectual property assets.<br><br>The lawyers in Brumbaugh, Inc.’ Antitrust Practice have substantial experience in representing clients in investigations and litigation related to the intersection between intellectual property and antitrust laws, including Standard Essential Patents. Our antitrust work, combined with a longstanding position at the forefront of antitrust / intellectual property policy developments in Europe and the U.S., provide us with deep insight into agencies’ enforcement priorities. We understand the strategic importance of intellectual property in a broad range of industries, new intellectual property business models and how valuable proprietary technology and related intellectual property assets are developed, protected, managed, licensed and monetized.<br><br>We represent clients across the full spectrum of antitrust matters involving intellectual property, covering antitrust clearances for mergers and acquisitions, agency investigations and counseling on a variety of issues including complex and strategic technology licensing, joint research and development coupled with joint licensing agreements, FRAND-licensing terms and injunctions, compulsory licensing, refusals to license and cross-licensing arrangements. Among our clients are intellectual property generators, owners, licensees, standard setting organizations and other companies and business organizations affected by or involved in intellectual property transactions. Our antitrust lawyers provide seamless cooperation with the firm’s full-service Intellectual Property Practice, which is one of the largest and most prominent in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Intellectual Property Litigation</h2>
<p>Brumbaugh, Inc. lawyers know IP cases because we understand the law, we understand complex litigation, we understand juries and we understand technology.<br><br>In addition, we have experience litigating in key venues around the world, including:<br><br>    All levels of the federal court system<br>    Patent Trial and Appeal Board<br>    International Trade Commission<br>    Federal Circuit appeals<br>    Patent Court and the Court of Appeal<br>    Matters before the UK and European Patent offices<br><br>Our IP Litigation lawyers have the technical education and experience to understand the most sophisticated technology and to communicate comfortably and confidently with engineers and scientists. For juries, we know how to translate complex information into lay terms. Collectively, we hold over 165 technical degrees, including Ph.D.s, master’s degrees and M.D. degrees. Many of our lawyers have worked in the private sector in science and engineering disciplines, and because of this, we are proficient at explaining complex technologies to judges and juries who lack technical backgrounds.<br><br>Our case preparation focuses on what matters – the objectives of our clients and developing and executing a strategy to achieve those objectives. While we frequently achieve our clients’ objectives without trial through settlement, alternative dispute resolution and tactical summary judgment practice, we try cases when necessary and have the right courtroom experience to effectively litigate in virtually any venue.<br><br>We try high-stakes patent, trade secret and other intellectual property cases in state and federal courtrooms around the United States, and are particularly adept at defending suits brought by non-practicing entities. Our reputation in the courtroom enhances our ability to achieve a business solution, such as a negotiated settlement, when that will best serve the needs of our client. Because our opponents respect that reputation, they are often motivated to explore all settlement possibilities before trial.<br><br>In addition to these trial results, we handle numerous patent cases before the International Trade Commission. Our experience in ITC proceedings, representing both complainants and respondents, provides us with the knowledge to effectively litigate ITC actions. We have a thorough knowledge of the ITC, its investigative staff and its administrative law judges. Our IP Litigation team includes a former President of the ITC Trial Lawyers Association.<br><br>We closely monitor ITC complaint filings on behalf of our clients to act immediately when a complaint is filed. Often, the complainant has had significant time to prepare its infringement case and the respondent must use what little time there is to formulate its defenses before discovery starts. Because the deadlines for discovery in the ITC are as little as 10 days and the hearing to determine liability for infringement usually occurs about 6 months after filing, every day counts in an ITC proceeding.</p>
<h2>International Trade Commission (ITC)</h2>
<p>Coupling the strengths of the firm's Patent Litigation and International Trade practice groups with their deep technical experience, the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") Section 337 practice at Brumbaugh, Inc. provides experienced legal representation to clients worldwide. We closely monitor the filing of ITC complaints on behalf of our clients so we can act immediately when a complaint is filed in the ITC. Because the deadlines for discovery in the ITC are as little as 10 days and the hearing to determine liability for infringement usually occurs about 6-9 months after filing, every day counts in an ITC proceeding. Often, the complainant has had significant time to prepare its infringement case, and the respondent must use what little time there is to formulate its defenses before discovery starts.</p>
<p><strong>ITC Litigation Experience and Staffing:</strong></p>
<p>We understand complexities of litigating in the ITC, we understand technology and we are adept at managing complex international trade issues under intense time pressure. For both complainants and respondents, we seek business solutions outside the courtroom that will accomplish a client’s objectives. Appeals from the decisions of the ITC in patent cases are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We have a robust Appeals practice and have handled innumerable appeals to the Federal Circuit, other Federal Circuit courts and the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Our partners and associates benefit from broad patent litigation and/or ITC experience; we assemble teams with thorough knowledge of the ITC, its investigative staff and its administrative law judges. Our group includes a former President of the ITC Trial Lawyers Association and we have gained insight serving as lead counsel to clients across a broad spectrum of industries.<br>About the ITC:<br><br>The U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC” or “Commission”) is a venue for resolving unfair trade practices, including patent disputes. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 provides for the investigation of any unfair act in the importation of articles into the United States, including the enforcement of intellectual property rights.<br><br>While almost all Section 337 investigations involve the alleged infringement of U.S. patent rights, the statute authorizes investigations to enforce other intellectual property rights such as trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, as well as address other unfair methods of competition.<br><br>If the Commission finds a violation of Section 337, it may issue an exclusion order banning imports of the infringing goods. It may also issue a cease-and-desist order requiring a party to stop all commercial activity relating to the infringing products subject to substantial civil penalties for violation. The Commission also issues temporary exclusion and cease and desist orders to curb infringing activity through the imposition of a bond pending formal resolution of the investigation.<br><br>Each remedial order issued by the Commission is reviewed by the President through the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to ensure there is no negative impact on U.S. foreign policy. Thereafter, final determinations by the Commission are appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<h2>Licensing</h2>

In addition to substantial experience in litigating intellectual property matters, we work with our clients to develop business approaches to increase the value of their intellectual property and generate significant revenue.<br><br>At Brumbaugh, Inc., we often handle licensing programs where the goal is to enhance financial returns on intellectual property assets. We help clients establish licensing programs, including identifying key intellectual property assets and potential infringers. Once they are put in place, we actively manage these programs, negotiate licenses and undertake litigation as appropriate. Our lawyers are skilled in planning, organizing and implementing long-range licensing programs involving numerous companies and large dollar amounts. Such programs can often be realized with little or no litigation.<br><br>Our Intellectual Property lawyers have the technical and business acumen to advise whenever intellectual property assets are part of business transactions. Whether the matter involves a single transaction or is part of much larger deal, we can structure solutions to meet the client’s objectives. For example, we can develop form contracts to document recurring transactions, provide tailored agreements for high-value projects, and negotiate development, acquisition, distribution, research, outsourcing and other agreements with third parties.<br><br>Brumbaugh, Inc. lawyers are also proficient at conducting intellectual property due diligence investigations in mergers and acquisitions for clients in all areas of technology. We are as comfortable working on behalf of an acquisition target—to assist an acquirer in performing its intellectual property due diligence with respect to the target—as we are conducting intellectual property due diligence of an acquisition target on behalf of an acquirer. Whenever intellectual property assets are developed, acquired, sold or shared, Brumbaugh, Inc. Intellectual Property lawyers have the technical and business experience to help with the transaction.</p>
<h2>Patent Prosecution</h2>
<p>Patents are perhaps the most tangible and enforceable types of intellectual property, and a well-written patent is essential to any business with an idea. It can be a starting point for licensing negotiations, a barrier to entry for competitors or a ticket into court. Brumbaugh, Inc.’ patent lawyers have extensive training and experience drafting, developing, asserting and defending patents. We prosecute and defend patents for companies of all sizes as well as individual inventors, academicians and universities.<br><br>During the patent process, our lawyers develop close working relationships with the innovators at your company. Through this collaboration, we explore the potential applications of the new technology or idea. The process also reveals the technological and financial ramifications of the patents, not only to your company but also to the industry as a whole. We emphasize claim construction with the goal of providing the broadest protection possible under federal law.<br><br>The diverse technical backgrounds of our Intellectual Property lawyers are extremely beneficial during patent prosecution. Our lawyers communicate well with scientists, programmers and engineers simply because most of our Intellectual Property lawyers have similar backgrounds. Whether you are patenting mechanical devices, medical products, computer software, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals or ideas in numerous other fields, we are likely to have a lawyer who has written such a patent.<br><br>Brumbaugh, Inc. will be with you every step of the way in the development and commercialization of technological innovations. We make sure that individual inventors, universities and companies are able to protect and profit from their significant investment in time and money.<br><br>Foreign Practice:<br>Our Intellectual Property lawyers understand that the procurement and protection of IP in major world markets is of paramount importance to a technology company’s longevity and prosperity in today’s global marketplace.

In response to this marketplace reality, our firm, in addition to offering traditional domestic patent services, can protect your ideas and patents worldwide.

<h2>Privacy and Data Security</h2>
<p>Brumbaugh, Inc. recognizes that data-protection and privacy issues are a concern for all companies that gather, store, or process the sensitive or personal information of their customers, third parties or employees. Privacy regulations around the world change constantly and the growth in technology available to transfer, manipulate, process, and access data shows no sign of abating.<br><br>Our lawyers, located around the world, are experienced in all data privacy issues. They regularly advise on compliance, including conducting privacy audits, creating privacy policies and website terms of use, negotiating and mitigating data privacy risk in commercial contracts and corporate transactions, representing clients in regulatory investigations, and in litigations.<br><br>Our cross-border team recognizes that privacy and data protection issues are truly international in scope. Data privacy affects all companies, whether based in the U.S. or internationally. Compliance with, and the extra-territorial impact of the new European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") is a particular issue for companies and our team works closely with our clients on all aspects of this ground-breaking legislation. Our lawyers are at the forefront of thought leadership on the topic.<br><br>Our Experience:<br><br>    Compliance strategies and advising on internal data audits, particularly in a global context involving the cross-border transfer of data<br>    The full range of commercial agreements where the handling of personal data is of paramount concern, including cloud services, information technology services, business process services, security services, and vendor contracts<br>    Drafting privacy policies and website terms of use<br>    Drafting compliant employment contracts<br>    Counseling on data privacy laws worldwide, including the EU's GDPR and e-Privacy legislation<br>    Regulatory investigations into data handling and breach<br>    The preparation of incident response strategies<br>    Disputes relating to data handling and data loss, including contractual claims and private rights of action</p>
<h2>PTAB Trials</h2>
<p>The most comprehensive patent reform in over sixty years was brought about by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (“AIA”), which includes a complete restructuring of the post-grant patent proceedings at the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office (“USPTO”).<br><br>Included in these reforms are the new post-grant procedures intended to provide a faster, more affordable alternative to traditional patent litigation in federal district court. Not only do these procedures have statutory time limits for completion, usually within one year of institution of a proceeding, but they impose significant restrictions on the breadth of discovery available to parties in order to facilitate compliance with the statutory time limits. Given the expedited timelines and significant differences from traditional patent litigation, to take advantage of these new processes for challenging patents, practitioners must possess a thorough understanding of the complexity of the AIA as well as how the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) the entity charged with handling these proceedings, is interpreting the Act.</p>
<p>Patent Prosecution Experience:<br><br>Our patent lawyers’ knowledge of patent prosecution, familiarity with the operations of the USPTO, and our courtroom skills differentiate us from competitors. Already Brumbaugh, Inc. lawyers have been engaged in more than 125 post-grant review proceedings before the PTAB. This combination of skills and experience makes our lawyers the natural choice for clients looking to pursue this new patent prosecution avenue.<br><br>Brumbaugh, Inc. maintains a team of accomplished and experienced professionals dedicated to understanding all aspects of the post-grant proceedings and are constantly monitoring all aspects of the AIA, including the various orders and decisions being issued by the PTAB on a near-daily basis. This team issues its Post-Grant Report on a regular basis commenting on key aspects of the AIA and provides context to important PTAB decisions.<br><br>In addition, Brumbaugh, Inc. IP lawyers are already recognized as skilled practitioners in the field. We were involved in the rulemaking regarding the creation of the PTAB following passage of the AIA, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and covered business method review.</p>
<p>Final Rules:<br><br>On August 14, 2012, the USPTO published final rules in the Federal Register to implement various Sections of the AIA, which became effective on September 16, 2012.<br><br>These rules address the following:<br><br>    Inter Partes Disputes (IPR)<br>    Changes to Implement Inter Partes Review Proceedings, Post-Grant Review Proceedings and Transitional Program for Covered Business Method Patents<br>    Rules of Practice for Trials Before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and Judicial Review of Patent Trial and Appeal Board Decisions<br>    Office Patent Trial Practice Guide</p>
